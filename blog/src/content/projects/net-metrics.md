## Project Overview

Net Metrics is an innovative analytics platform designed to revolutionize volleyball player development through comprehensive data tracking and analysis. By combining video analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, this platform provides coaches and players with actionable insights to improve performance.

## Core Features

### Performance Tracking
- **Attack Efficiency**: Track hitting percentage, kill rate, and attack angles
- **Serve Analysis**: Monitor serve velocity, placement accuracy, and ace percentage
- **Defensive Metrics**: Measure dig success rate, coverage area, and reaction times
- **Setting Precision**: Analyze set location accuracy and tempo variations

### Video Integration
- Synchronized video playback with statistical events
- Automatic highlight reel generation for key plays
- Frame-by-frame biomechanical analysis
- Multi-angle camera support for comprehensive coverage

### Player Development Tools
- Personalized training recommendations based on performance gaps
- Skill progression tracking over time
- Comparison with position-specific benchmarks
- Injury risk assessment through workload monitoring

## Technical Architecture

The platform leverages modern technologies to deliver real-time insights:

### Data Collection
- Custom computer vision algorithms for automatic event detection
- Integration with Catapult and VERT wearable sensors
- Manual tagging interface for detailed play-by-play analysis

### Analytics Engine
- PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- Python-based statistical analysis pipeline
- TensorFlow models for predictive analytics
- Real-time data processing for live match insights

### User Interface
- React-based responsive web application
- D3.js for interactive data visualizations
- Mobile app for on-court data entry
- Coach dashboard with team-wide analytics

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Real-time Video Processing
Processing multiple camera feeds in real-time while maintaining accuracy required optimizing our computer vision algorithms and implementing edge computing solutions.

### Challenge 2: Data Standardization
Creating a unified data model that accommodates various volleyball levels (youth, high school, college, professional) and different scoring systems.

### Challenge 3: User Experience
Designing an interface that presents complex analytics in an intuitive way for coaches who may not have extensive technical backgrounds.
