I’m always surprised when talking with people about politics. Their opinions—which sometimes differ drastically from mine—aren’t what surprise me; it’s their certainty and confidence. Even when their views align with my own, I’m struck by how sure we can sound about systems we only dimly understand.

This naïve confidence is often reinforced by sheer strength in numbers. We adopt the opinions of people we admire and, because we respect them, treat their non-expert takes as infallible. Worse, we rarely verify those claims; instead, we lazily label the information as fact. These “facts” are usually tangled with nuance, trade-offs, and fallacies, but ignoring complications is easier—especially when the claims flatter what we already believe.

Psychologists have discussed this tendency for decades—cognitive dissonance was first described in the late 1950s—but it struck me anew while re-watching one of my favorite shows:

> “Advertising is based on happiness… It’s the smell of a new car, freedom from fear, a billboard that screams whatever you’re doing is okay.”
— [Don Draper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9rrhKgusYs), Mad Men

Draper describes the easy road: you don’t win people with data or analysis; you bathe them in emotionally comforting “facts” that short-circuit deeper thinking and whisper, Relax—you’ve already made the right choice.

Partisan outlets use the same playbook, serving information in ways that keep you “sticky” to their channel.

## Tactic - New-Car Smell
High-production graphics and dramatic “Breaking News” sound effects seize attention before analysis starts.

## Tactic - ADT
> “We’re Home Even When You’re Not”

Narratives claiming only our side can protect you from immigrants, crime, or economic ruin heighten threat perception and shut down deliberation.

## Tactic - AllState
> "You're in good hands" (with AllState)

Familiar hosts echo your worldview, wrapping you in a warm identity blanket you won’t want to leave.

## Engaging System 2

Daniel Kahneman popularized System 1 and System 2 thinking:
* System 1 is lightning-fast, emotional, and prone to bias.
* System 2 is slow, deliberate, and capable of overriding System 1—but it can be lazy and rubber-stamp first impressions.

Partisan outlets aim for System 1, hoping to keep System 2 asleep. The antidote is deliberate self-questioning. 
* When you feel that warm glow of certainty, pause and ask Why do I feel this way?
* Probe the cues—images, adjectives, music—rather than the claims themselves.
* Then ask: Do the core facts still stand without the packaging?
